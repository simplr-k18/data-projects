# Real-World Data Projects

This is my attempt to solve **real-world user and business pain points** using data â€” with elegance, clarity, and purpose.

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo?

- To rethink how data can *actually* improve decisions, not just report them
- To showcase how I combine **product thinking**, **data design**, and **storytelling**
- To build things that feel simple, obvious â€” like they were always meant to be

## What's Inside?

Each folder is a **self-contained project**, with:
- The original problem or pain point (`story.md`)
- The approach (SQL, Python, Power BI, etc.)
- Output: visuals, insights, models
- My notes, reflections, and what I would improve
